# Inspiration

This is a small Android app to relieve indecisiveness.
You can create lists for Meals, Dates, Trips, etc. and choose one of the entries randomly. If you don't like your pick, simply choose again.


# Installation

Install the [app-release.apk](app-release.apk) file on an android device. The app is signed and doesn't require any permissions.
